This project has been made as a submission for [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com) Front End Development Libraries certification to practice what I have learned in [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) course.

For generating random quotes [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) API has been used.
